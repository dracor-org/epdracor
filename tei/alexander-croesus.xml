        <head>The Argument. </head>
        <p>AT that time when the states of Greece began to growe great, and Philosophie to be thought pretious, Solon the first light of the Athenian common-wealth like a prouident Bee gathering honnie ouer many fields, learning knowledge ouer many countries, was sent for by Croesus King of Lidia as famous for his Wealth, as the other was for his Wisedome. And not so much for any desire the King had to profit by the experience of so profound a Philosopher, as to haue the report of his (as he thought it) happines approoued by the testimonie of so renoumed a witnesse. But Solon always like himselfe entring the regall Pallace, and seeing the same very gloriously apparelled, but very incommodiouslie furnished with Courtiers, more curious to haue their bodies deckt with a womanishlie affected forme of rayment, and some superficiall complements of pretended curtesies, then to haue their minds enriched with the true treasure of inestimable vertue, he had the same altogether in disdaine. Therefore after some conference had with Croesus concerning the felicitie of man, his opinion not seconding the Kings expectation, he was returned with contempt as one of no vnderstanding. But yet comforted by Aesop (Authour of the wittie fables) who for the time was resident at Court, and in credit with the King. </p>
        <p>Immediately after the departure of Solon, Croesus hauing two Sonnes (whereof the eldest was dumbe, and the other a braue youth) dreamd that the yongest dyed by the wound of a dart, wherewith being maruellously troubled, he maried him to a Gentlewoman named Caelia, and for farther disapointing the suspected, though ineuitable destinie, he discharged the vsing of all such weapons as he had dreamed of. Yet who could cut away the occasion from the heauens of accomplishing that which they had designd. The spiritfull youth being long restraind from the fields, was inuited by some countrie-men to the chace of a wild Boare, yet could very hardlie impetrate leaue of his louinglie suspitious father. </p>
        <p>Now in the meane time there arriued at Sardis a youth named Adrastus, Sonne to the King of Phrigia, one no lesse infortunate then valourous, <pb xml:id="eng000258-003-b"/>he hauing lost his mistresse by a great disaster, and hauing kild his brother by a farre greater, came to Croesus, by whom he was courteously entertaind, and by the instancie of the King, and the instigation of others against his owne will, who feared the frowardnes of his infectious fortune, he got the custodie of Atis (so was the Prince called) whom in time of the sport thinking to kill the Boare, by a monstrous mishap he killed. After which disastrous accident standing aboue the dead corps after the inquirie of the truth being pardoned by Croesus, he punished himselfe by a violent death. There after, Croesus sorrowing exceedingly this exceeding misfortune, he was comforted by Sandanis, who laboured to disswade him from his vnnecessary iourney against the Persians, yet he reposing on superstitious, and wrong interpreted responses of deceauing oracles, went against Cyrus, who hauing defeated his forces in the field, and taken himselfe in the Citie, tyed him to a stake to be burned, where by the exclaiming diuers times on the name of Solon, mouing the Conquerour to compassion, he was set at libertie, and lamenting the death of his Sonne, and the losse of his Kingdome, makes the Catastrophe of this present Tragedie. </p>
