        <head>METROPOLIS CORONATA: OR, The olde Drapery and Cloathing <hi>of England, triumphing a second Yeere. </hi>
        </head>
        <p>HAuing in our last yeeres discourse of <hi>Himatia Poleos</hi>, sufficiently approued the true antiquitie, and primary Honour of Englands Draperie, heere in the Citie of London, first granted by King RICHARD the first, and seconded by his brother King Iohn, by enstalling that famous noble Gentleman, <hi>Sir Henry Fitz-Alwine </hi>Knight, in the first dignity of L. Maior of London, wherein he continued (by yeerely election) the space of twenty foure yeeres and an halfe, and longer had done, if hee had longer liued: Seeing likewise, that Drapery triumpheth now two yeers together, by succession of two Lord Maiors in one and the same Society: I held it not fit (finding my selfe not barren of inuention, in a Theame of such scope and large extendure) to runne againe the same course of antique honour: but rather to iumpe with the time, which <pb xml:id="ep000207-003-a"/>uermore affecteth nouelty, in a new forme of this second yeeres triumph, prepared for that honourable and worthy brother of Drapery, Sir <hi>Iohn Iolles</hi>, Knight and Alderman, on the day of his entrance into so high a dignitie. </p>
        <p>On Monday, being the 30. of October, 1615. according to auncient and most honourable custome, the L. Maior being to passe by water to Westminster, in company of his worthy Brethren, and attended by all other Companies in their seuerall Bardges made fit for triumph, after such manner as formerly hath been obserued: The first deuice that welcommeth him to the water, is an inuention proper to that nature, and thought apt to conduct him in his passage. He being both a Draper and Stapler, and these two professions (in former times) appertaining to the Brethren of Londons Drapery, trading only in wools and woollen cloth, the then chiefe riches of the kingdome: both these mysteries meeting together so conueniently in one man, I did account it as a sinne in me to sunder them, and therefore made vse of that Creast or Cognizaunce of the Golden Fliece, giuen by auncient Heraldrie to them both, and remaining still in firme force with the Draper, as their Escutchion of Armes maketh manifest. </p>
        <p>In a goodly Argoe, shaped so neere as Art could yeeld it, to that of such auncient and honourable fame, as conuaied Iason and his valiant Argonautes of Greece, to fetch away the Golden fleece from Cholchos; we make vse of that memorable historie, as fit both for the time and occasion. Therein aloft sitteth Medea, whose loue to Iason, was his best meanes for obtaining <pb xml:id="ep000207-003-b"/>the Golden fleece: And therefore, as still witnessing the fiery zeale of her affection towards him, she sitteth playing with his loue-lockes, and wantoning with him in all pleasing daliance, to compasse the more settled assurance of his constancy: His noble Companions, as <hi>Hercules, Telamon, Orpheus, Castor, Pollux, Calais </hi>and Zethes the Sonnes of Boreas, are seated about him in their seuerall degrees, attired in faire guilt Armours, bearing triumphall Launces, wreathed about with Lawrell, Shields honoured with the Impresse of the Golden fleece, and their heads circled with Lawrell, according to the manner of all famous Conquerors. This Argoe is rowed by diuers comely Eunuches, which continually attended on Medea, and she fauouring them but to passe vnder the fleece of Golde, had all their garments immediatly sprinkled ouer with golde, euen as if it had showred downe in droppes vpon them, and so they rowe on in Iasons triumph. </p>
        <p>Hauing thus borrowed the helpe of this well knowne storie, to honour the day of our <hi>London Iason</hi>: we doe Poetically inferre, that Neptune hauing declared himselfe kinde in their comming hither, and Thamesis shewen her selfe as gracious, in passing ouer her watry bosome, To make his triumph more maiecall, they lend the assistance of their Sea Chariot, wherein they vse to sport themselues on their watry regiment, it being shaped like to a Whale, or the huge Leuiathan of the Sea. Therein is placed the shadow of Sir <hi>Henry Fitz-Alwine</hi>, to grace this dayes honour, both by water and land, and by him are seated eight royall Vertues, bearing the Ensignes of <pb xml:id="ep000207-004-a"/>Armes of eight honourable Drapers and Staplers, with beautiful shields, that declare each mans name, <hi>vz. Poultney, Cromer, Aeyre, Wotton, Sidney, Bulloin, Capell, Champion. </hi>Many more we could haue brought to accompanie them, but neither place nor time might afford it: only these are remembred for their high deseruings, as our Chronicles (at large) doe more amply declare, Fame triumphing in the top, and Time guiding the way before. No sooner is my Lord and his Brethren seated in their Bardge, and such silence obtained as the season can best permit: but Fitz-Alwine saluteth him in this manner. </p>

              <p>FIrst, a faire and beautifull Shippe, stiled by the Lord Maiors name, and called the Ioell, appearing to bee lately returned, from trafficking Wool and Cloth with other remote Countryes; vshereth the way for her worthy Owners seruice, and is well gouerned by her Captaine, Master, Mate, &amp;c. Neptune, who hath been auspicious to all her aduentures, and Thamesis, by bringing her alwaies safely within her owne bounds, beeing mounted in triumphall manner, the one on a pelletted Lyon, the supporter to the Drapers Armes, and the other on a sea-Horse, belonging to the Lord Maiors Armorie, doe both (with their presence) approue this dayes delighting. Then followeth a goodly Ramme or Golden Fleece, the honoured Creast (as already hath been sayd) to Drapers and Staplers, hauing (on each side) a housewifely Virgin sitting, seriously imployed in Carding and Spinning Wooll for Cloth, the very best commoditie that euer this Kingdome yeelded. The Argoe succeedeth this Fleece or Ramme, according to our former description: and then, in stead of Neptunes Whale on the water, commeth another Sea-deuice, tearmed <hi>The Chariot of Mans life</hi>, answerable in all respects to Times relation thereof; as also that other Monument of London and her twelue Daughters, at this time imploying <hi>Metropolis Coronata</hi>, the Kings chiefe Citty and Chamber, most desertfully <pb xml:id="ep000207-007-b"/>crowned, as being the ancient Mother of the whole Land, and first receiuing honour, by the triple imperiall Crownes of Draperie. </p>

        <p>After all these shewes, thus ordered in their appointed places, followeth another deuice of Huntsmen, all clad in greene, with their Bowes, Arrowes and Bugles, and a new slaine Deere carried among them. It sauoureth of Earle <hi>Robert de la Hude</hi>, sometime the noble Earle of Huntington, and Sonne in Law (by Marriage) to olde Fitz-Alwine, raised by the Muses all-commanding power, to honour this Triumph with his Father. During the time of his out-lawed life, in the Forrest of merry Sherwood, and elsewhere, while the cruell oppression of a most vnnaturall couetous Brother hung heauy vpon him, <hi>Gilbert de la Hude</hi>, Lord Abbot of Christall Abbey, who had all, or most of his Lands in morgage: hee was commonly called <hi>Robin Hood</hi>, and had a gallant company of men (Out-lawed in the like manner) that followed his downecast fortunes, and honoured him as their Lord and Master; as little <hi>Iohn Scathlocke, Much </hi>the Millers sonne, <hi>Right-hitting Brand</hi>, Frvar Tuck, and many more. In which condition of life we make instant vse of him, and part of his braue Bowmen, fitted with Bowes and Arrowes, of the like strength and length, as good Records deliuer testimonie, were then vsed by them in their killing of Deere. </p>

              <p>HOnourable Lord, Time hath nothing else to tel you, but the briefe meaning of these seuerall inuentions. The water-deuices haue already sufficiently spoken themselues. This Ship, bearing your owne name, and called the IOEL, trafficking Englands Drapery with all other Countries, as by the goodly Ramme or golden Fleece of England appeareth, where two Houswifely Virgins sit carding and spinning, is (after many happie voyages) returned to honour the day of her worthie Owner, being safely brought home by Neptune and Thamesis, who (mounted on a Lyon and Sea-horse) vouchsafe their attendance on your triumph. And in stead of that Sea Chariot, which waited on the Argoe in <pb xml:id="ep000207-008-b"/>the morning, they bring another, graced with the same Royall Vertues, and Ensignes of Armes belonging to those honourable Drapers. On the top is placed a Spheare or Globe, intimating the world, created for the vse of man, and such expence of time as is allotted him. It is supported by the foure Elements, Water, Earth, Ayre, and Fire, as their figures and Emblemes doe aptly declare. It runneth on seuen wheeles, describing the seuen ages of man; his Infancie, Child-hood, Adolescency, or Stripling estate, Youth-hood, Man-hood, Age, and Ages extremity, or decrepit condition: all of them subiected to the power of the seuen Planets, as on each wheele they beare their Characters. It is drawne by two Lyons and two Horses of the Sea, figuring what swift motion hastneth on the minutes, houres, months and yeeres of our frailtie: and the whole frame or body guided by Time, as Coach-man to the life of man. That other goodly Monument or Pageant, with the glorious Sunne in continuall motion ouer it, appertaining to the Drapers Armory; presents yee London in the supreme place of eminence, and the twelue Companies (her twelue Daughters) all seated about her in their due degrees, onely Drapery is neerest to her, as being the first and chiefest honoured Society before all other. As supports to Londons flourishing happinesse, and continuance of the same in true tranquilitie: foure goodly Mounts (as strong and defensiue bulwarkes) are raysed about her, bearing Emblemes of those foure especiall qualities, which make any Common-wealth truly happy. Learned Religion, <pb xml:id="ep000207-009-a"/>Militarie Discipline, Nauigation, and Home-bred Husbandrie. </p>
              <lg>
                <l>For thus, my Lord, I truely vnderstand, </l>
                <l>No greater Crosse can hap to any Land, </l>
                <l>Then lacke of Schollars, Souldiers, Saylers, Husband-men, </l>
                <l>Long may we haue them all, Time sayes Amen. </l>

        <p>Euening hastening on speedily, and those vsuall Ceremonies at Paules being accomplished: darkenesse becommeth like bright day, by bountifull allowance of lighted Torches, for guyding all the seuerall shewes, and my Lord homeward. The way being somewhat long, the order of march appeared the more excellent and commendable, euen as if it had been a Royall Maske, prepared for the marriage of an immortall Deitie, as in the like nature we hold the Lord Maior, to be this day solemnely married to Londons supreame Dignitie, by representing the awefull authority of soueraigne Maiestie. No sooner commeth he to his owne Gate, but there our supposed Sir <hi>Henry Fitz-Alwine</hi>, on behalfe of the honourable company of Drapers, who made no spare of their bounty, for full performance of this dayes solemne Honor; speaketh this ensuing speech. </p>
