          <p>Phansie, in a sute of severall coloured Feathers hooded. A paire of Bats-wings on his shoulders, riding alone as sole presenter of the Antimasques. </p>
          <p>After him rode Opinion and Confidence together, Opinion in an old fashioned Doublet of blacke Velvet, and truncke Hose, a short Cloake of the same with an antique Cape, a blacke Velvet cap pinch'd up, with a white fall, a Staffe in his hand. </p>
          <pb n="2" xml:id="ep000821-004-a"/>
          <p>Confidence in a slash'd Doublet parti-coloured Breeches sutable with poynts at knees, favours upon his breast, and arme: a broad brim'd Hat, tied upon one side, banded with a Feather, a long Locke of Haire, trim'd with severall coloured Ribbands, wide Boots, and great Spurres with Bels for rowels. </p>
          <p>Next rode Iollity and Laughter. Iollity in a flame-coloured Suite, but trick'd like a Morise-dancer, with Scarfes and Napkins, his Hat fashioned like a Cone, with a little fall. </p>
          <p>Laughter in a long side Coate of severall colours, laughing Visards on his breast and backe, a Cap with two grinning faces, and Feathers betweene. </p>
          <p>Then followed variety of Anticke musicke after which rode sixe Proiectors, one after another, their horses led by Torch-bearers. </p>
          <p>The first a Iocky with a Bonnet on his head upon the top of it a whip, he seeming much to obserue and affect a bridle which he had in his hand. </p>
          <p>The second a Country fellow in a Leather Doubled and gray trunke Hose, a wheele with a perpetuall motion on his head, and in his hand a flayle. </p>
          <p>The third, a grimme Philosopicall fac'd fellow in his gowne furr'd, and girdled about him, a furnace upon his head, and in his hand a lampe. </p>
          <p>The fourth in a case of blacke Leather vast to the middle, and round on the top, with glasse eyes, and bellowes under each arme. </p>
          <p>The fist a Physition, on his head a Hat with a bunch of Carrots, a Capon perched upon his fist. </p>
          <pb n="3" xml:id="ep000821-004-b"/>

          <p>Here variety of other Anticke musicke counterfeiting the voyces of Birds, and after these rode, a Magpy, a Crow, a Iay, and a Kite, in a quadrangular figure, and in the midst an Owle, these were followed by three Satires, two a breast, and one single, sided with torch-bearers. Then three Dotterels in the same manner and attendance. </p>
          <p>After these a Windmill, against which a phantasticke Knight with his Lance, and his Squire arm'd seem'd to make their attempts. </p>
          <p>These moving forward in ridiculous shew and postures, a Drummer followeth on Horsebacke, in a Crimson taffata coate, a white Hat and Feather, tip'd with crimson, beating two kettle Drummes. </p>
          <p>Then 14. Trumpetors, in crimson Satten coates, white Hats and Feathers, and rich Banners. </p>
          <p>The Marshall followed these bravely mounted. attended with forty foote, in Cotes and Hose of Scarlet trim'd with Silver-lace, white Hats and Feathers, their Truncheons tip'd with Silver: these upon every occasion moving to and fro, to preserue the order of their march, and restraine the rudenesse of people, that in such triumphs, are wont to be insolent, and tumultuary. </p>
          <p>After these an hundred Gentlemen, gloriously furnished and gallantly mounted, riding two and two a breast, every Gentleman having his two Pages richly attired, and a groome to attend him. </p>
          <pb n="4" xml:id="ep000821-005-a"/>
          <p>Next after these a Chariot drawne by foure horses, two and two together, richly furnished and adorn'd with Gold and Silver, the Charioter in a Polonian coate of greene cloth of Silver.

In a seate a little more elevate sate Geniu, and Amphiluchs. </p>
          <p>On the highest seate of this Chariot, sate the three Howers, or Heavenly sisters, Irene, Diche, and Eunomia. All whose habits shall be described in their proper places: this Chariot attended as the former. </p>
          <p>After these came the foure Triumphals or Magnificent Chariots, in which were mounted the grand Masquers, one of the foure Houses in euery Chariot, seated within an halfe Ovall, with a glorious Canopy over their heads, all bordered with silver Fringe, and beautified with Plumes of Feathers on the top. </p>

            <item>The fourth, Siluer &amp; White. </item>
          </list>
          <p>All after the Romane forme, adorned with much embossed and carved workes, and each of them wrought with Silver, and his seuerall colour, they were mounted on carriages, the Spring trees, Pole and Axle-trees, the Charioters seate, and standers, wheeles, with the fellyes, spokes, and naves all wrought with Silver, and their severall colour. </p>

          <p>Betweene every of these Chariots foure Musitians in their Robes and Garlands, were mounted; riding two a breast, attended with Torch-bearers. </p>
          <p>The Habit of the Masquers gaue infinite splendor to this solemnity; which more aptly shall be expressed in his Place. </p>
          <pb n="6" xml:id="ep000821-006-a"/>
          <p>This Masque was presented in the Banquetting-house. At white Hall before the King and Queenes Maiesties and a great Assembly of Lords and Ladies, and other persons of quality, whose aspect setting on the degrees prepared for that purpose gaue a great grace to this spectacle, especially being all richly attired. </p>
          <p>At the lower end of the roome opposite to the state was raysed a Stage with a descent of staires in two branches landing into the roome. This Basement was painted in rusticke worke. </p>
          <p>The border of the front and sides that enclosed all the Sceane had first a ground of Arber-worke entermixt with loose branches and leaues, and in this was two Niches, and in them two great figures standing in easy postures in their naturall colors, and much bigger then the life, the one attired after the Grecian manner held in one hand a Scepter, and in the other a Scrowle, and a picked antique crowne on his head, his curasse was of Gold richly enchased, his robe blue and Siluer, his armes and thighs bare with buskings enricht with ornaments of Gold, his browne locks long and curled, his Beard thicke but not long, and his face was of a grave and ioviall aspect, this figure stood on a round pedestall fained of white Marble, enricht with severall caruings; above this in a compartiment of Gold was written MINOS.

The upper part in manner of a large Freeze was adorn'd with severall compartiments with draperies hanging downe, and the ends tied up in knots, with trophies proper to feasts and triumphs, composed of Masking Vizards and torches. In one of the lesser compartiments was figured a sharpe sited eye, and in the other a Golden-yoke, in the midst was a more great and rich compartiment on the sides of which sate naked Children in their naturall colors with Siluer wings in action of sounding Golden Trumpets, and in this was figured a Caduseus with an Oliue-branch all which are Hierogliphicks of Peace Iustice and Law. </p>
