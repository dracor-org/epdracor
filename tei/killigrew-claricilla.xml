            <p>I should blush at this, if there needed more Arguments to confirm I shall be victorious than the reward propos'd; for had the Gods intended the far-fam'd Claricilla's Virtues a Reward for Treason they would not then have left her Virtue such a Guard, whose power hath stood amongst Traitors when yours fell upon the faith that bore it. </p>

            <p>You oblige me, Sir, and this goodness makes me beg you would be pleas'd to let me once again call to your memory some particulars of that tedious story which so often in my miseries I recounted to your Highness: This Traitor Silvander having by my love gain'd an interest, and by my smiles climb'd o're the Heads of all his Fellows in the strength of that trust grew too powerfull for me, and in a Battel (where my cause onely struck) our Forces being not half the Traitors number we lost the day, to which Theft, not Conquest, was joyn'd the Murder of my Brother and loss both of my Crown and Daughter. </p>
