        <p>TO you (as whom this Play most especially concernes) I thought good to dedicate this Labour, which though written many yeares since, in my Infancy of Iudgement in this kinde of Poetry, and my first practise: yet vnderstanding (by what meanes I know not) it was in these more exquisit &amp; refined Times to come to the Presse, in such a forwardnesse ere it came to my knowledge, that it was past preuention, and knowing withall, that it comes short of that accuratenesse both in Plot and Stile, that these more Censorious dayes with greater curiosity acquire, I must <pb xml:id="ep000060-003-a"/>thus excuse. That as Playes were then some fifteene or sixteene yeares agoe it was in the fashion. Nor could it haue found a more seasonable and fit publication then at this Time, when, to the glory of our Nation, the security of the Kingdome, and the honour of the City, they haue begunne againe the commendable practise of long forgotten Armes, the continuance of which I wish, the discipline approue, and the encouragement thereof euen with my soule applaude. In which great and hoped good they deserue not the least attribute of approbation: who, in the dull and sleepy time of peace, first waken'd the remembrance of these armes in the Artillery garden, which begun out of their voluntary affections, prosecuted by their priuate industries, and continued at their owne proper cost and charge, deserues in my opinion, not onely respect and regard, but recompence <pb xml:id="ep000060-003-b"/>and reward. But to returne againe to you, my braue spirited Prentises, vpon whom I haue freely bestowed these Foure I I wish you all, that haue their courages and forwardnesse, their noble Fates and Fortunes, </p>
        <p>Yours, </p>

        <head>The Prologue. </head>
        <stage xml:id="ep000060-e100400">Enter three in blacke clokes, at three doores. </stage>
        <p n="1">1 WHat meane you, my maisters, to appeare thus before your times? Doe you not know that I am the Prologue? Do you not see this long blacke veluet cloke vpon my backe? Haue you not sounded thrice? Do I not looke pale, as fearing to bee out in my speech? Nay, haue I not all the signes of a Prologue about me? Then, to what end come you to interrupt mee? </p>
        <p n="2">2 I haue a Prologue to speake too. </p>
        <p n="3">3 And I another. </p>
        <p n="1">1 O superfluous, and more then euer I heard of! three Prologues to one play! </p>
        <p n="2">2 Haue you not seene three ropes to tole one bell, three doores to one house, three wayes to one towne? </p>
        <p n="1">1 I grant you: but I neuer heard of any that had three heads to one body, but Cerberus. But what doth your Prologue meane? </p>
        <p n="2">2 I come to excuse the name of the Play? </p>
        <p n="3">3 I the errours in the Play. </p>
        <p n="1">1 And I the Author that made the Play. Touching the name, why is it called, True and Strange, or The foure Prentises of London? A Gentleman that heard the subiect discourst, said it was not possible to be true; and none here are bound to beleeue it. </p>
        <p n="2">2 Tis true, that Alexander at thirty yeares of age conquered the whole world; but strange he should doe so. If we should not beleeue things recorded in former ages, wee were <pb xml:id="ep000060-005-a"/>not worthy that succeeding times should beleeue things done in these our ages. </p>
        <p n="1">1 But what authority haue you for your History? I am one of those that wil beleeue nothing that is not in the Chronicle. </p>
        <p n="2">2 Our authority is a Manuscript, a booke writ in parchment; which not being publique, nor generall in the world, wee rather thought fit to exemplifie to the publique censure, things concealed and obscur'd, such as are not common with euery one, than such Historicall Tales as euery one can tell by the fire in Winter. Had not yee rather, for nouelties sake, see Ierusalem yee neuer saw, then London that yee see howerly? So much touching the name of our History. </p>
        <p n="1">1 You haue satisfied me; and, I hope, all that heare me. Now what haue you to speake concerning the errours in the Play? </p>
        <p n="3">3 We acknowledge none: For the errors we could finde, we would willingly amend; but if these cleere-sighted Gentlemen, with the eyes of their iudgements, looking exactly into vs, finde any imperfections which are hid from our selues, our request is, you would rather looke ouer them, then through them, not with a troubled eye, that makes one obiect to seeme two, but with a fauourable eye, which hath power in it selfe to make many to seeme none at all. </p>
        <p n="1">1 Oh now I vnderstand you. Three Prologues to our Play, pardon mee, y'aue need of three hundred, me thinkes, and all little enough. But to end our beginning in a word. Thus much by the patience of these Gentlemen. </p>
        <p>Spectators, should you oppose your iudgements against vs: where we are three, which some would thinke too many; were we three thousand, we thinke our selues to few. Our Author submits his labours to you, as the Authors of all the content he hath within this circumference. </p>
        <lg>
          <l>But for your sakes, this onely we dare say, </l>
          <l>We promist you, and wee'l performe a Play. </l>

        <p>The textual notes below aim at making textual corrections readable in their immediate context and facilitating access to the source text. A five-digit number preceded by 'A' or 'B' represents an EEBO-TCP filenumber. A notation like "6-b-2890" means "look for EEBO page image 6 of that text, word 289 on the right side of the double-page image." That reference is followed by the corrupt reading. A black dot stands for an unidentified letter, a black square for an unidentified punctuation mark, a diamond for a missing word, and the ellipsis for a short span of undefined length. The corrected reading is displayed as a keyword in context.</p>
