        <head>PREFACE. </head>
        <p>TO speak for a Play, if it can't speak for it self, is vain; and if it can, 'tis needless. For one of these Reasons (I can't yet tell which, for 'tis now but the second day of Acting) I resolve to say nothing for Aesop, though I know he'd be glad of help; for let the best happen that can, his Journey's up Hill, with a dead English weight at the Tayl of him. </p>
        <p>At Paris indeed, he scrambled up something faster (for 'twas up Hill there too) than I'm afraid he will do here. The French having more Mercury in their Heads, and less Beef and Pudding in their Bellies. Our Solidity may set hard, what their Folly makes easy; for Fools I own they are, you know we have found 'em so, in the Conduct of the War: I wish we may do so, in the management of the Peace; but that's neither Aesop's Business, nor mine. </p>
        <p>This Play, Gentlemen (or one not much unlike it) was writ in French about Six Years since, by one Monsieur Boursaut, 'twas play'd at Paris by the French Comedians, and this was its Fate. </p>
        <p>The first day it appear'd, 'twas routed (People seldom being fond of what they don't understand, their own sweet Persons excepted). The second (by the help of some bold Knight Errants) it rally'd. The third it advanc'd, the fourth it gave a vigorons Attacque, and the fifth put all the Feathers in Town to the scamper; pursuing <pb xml:id="ep000778-003-a"/>'em on the fourteenth, and then they cry'd out Quarter. </p>
        <p>'Tis not reasonable to expect, Aesop should gain so great a Victory here, since 'tis possible by fooling with his Sword, I may have turn'd the edge on't. For I confess in the Translation, I have not at all stuck to the Original; Nay I have gone farther, I have wholly added the Fifth Act, and crowded a Country Gentleman into the Fourth, for which I ask Monsieur Boursaut's Pardon, with all my heart, but doubt I never shall obtain it, for bringing him into such Company. Though after all, had I been so complaisant to have waited on his Play word for word, 'tis possible even that might not have ensur'd the success of it. For though it swam in France, it might have sunk in England. Their Country abounds in Cork, ours in Lead. </p>

        <head>PROLOGUE. </head>
        <l>GAllants; We never yet produc'd a Play, </l>
        <l>With greater fears, than this we act to day. </l>
        <l>Barren of all the Graces of the Stage, </l>
        <l>Barren of all that entertains this Age. </l>
        <l>No Hero, no Romance, no Plot, no Show, </l>
        <l>No Rape, no Bawdy, no Intrigue, no Beau: </l>
        <l>There's nothing in't, with which we use to please ye: </l>
        <l>With down right dull Instruction, w'are to tease ye, </l>
        <l>The stage turns Pulpit; and the World's so fickle, </l>
        <l>The Play-House in a whim, turns Conventicle. </l>
        <l>But Preaching here, must prove a hungry Trade, </l>
        <l>The Pattentees will find so, I'm afraid. </l>
        <l>For though with Heavenly Zeal, you all abound, </l>
        <l>As by your Lives and Morals may be found, </l>
        <l>Though every Female here o're flows with Grace, </l>
        <l>And Chast Diana's written in her Face; </l>
        <l>Though Maids renounce the sweets of Fornication, </l>
        <l>And one Lewd Wife's not left in all the Nation; </l>
        <l>Though Men grow true, and the foul Fiend defy. </l>
        <l>Though Trades-men cheat no more, nor Lawyers ly. </l>
        <l>Though not one spot be found on Levi's Tribe, </l>
        <l>Nor one soft Courtier, that will touch a Bribe: </l>
        <l>Yet in the mid'st of such Religious Days, </l>
        <l>Sermons have never born the Price of Plays. </l>

            <p>Sir, 'Tis not the first time I have been taken for a Countess, my Mother us'd to say, as I lay in my Cradle, I had the Air of a Woman of Quality; and truly, I have always liv'd like such. My Husband, indeed, had something Sneaking in him (as most Husbands have, you know Sir) but from the Moment I set foot in his House, bless me, what a Change was there! His Pewter was turn'd into Silver; his Goloshoes into a Glass Coach, and his little Travelling Mare into a pair of Flanders Horses. Instead of a greasie Cook-Maid to wait at Table, I had four tall Foot-men, in clean Linen; all things became new and fashionable, and nothing look'd aukward in my Family. My Furniture was the wonder of my Neighbourhood, and my Cloaths the admiration of the whole Town; I had a Necklace that was envy'd by the Queen, and a pair of Pendants that set a Dutchess a crying. In a word, <pb n="34" xml:id="ep000778-021-a"/>I saw nothing I lik'd, but I bought it; and my Husband, good Man, durst ne'er refuse paying for't. Thus I liv'd, and I flourish'd, till he sickned, and dy'd; but e'er he was cold in his Grave, his Creditors plunder'd my House. But what pity it was to see Fellows with dirty Shoes, come into my best Rooms, and touch my Hangings with their filthy Fingers. You won't blame me, Sir, if with all my Courage, I weep at this sensible part of my Misfortune. </p>

Having been inform'd this Morning, That the King has appointed a great Sum of Money, for the Marriage of young Women who have liv'd well, and are fallen to decay: I am come to acquaint you, I have two strapping Daughters just fit for the Matter; and to desire you'll help. 'em to Portions out of the King's Bounty, that they mayn't whine and pine, and be eaten up with the Green Sickness, as half the young Women in the Town are, or wou'd be, if there were not more helps for a Disease than one.

            <p>This, Widow, I take to be your Case, and that of a great many others; for this is an Age, where most People get falls, by clambering too high, to reach at what they should not do. The Shoemaker's Wife reduces her Husband to a Cobler, by endeavouring to be as Spruce as the Taylors: The Taylor's brings hers to a Botcher, by going as fine as the Mercers; The Mercer's lowers hers to a Foreman, by perking up to the Merchants; The Merchant's wears hers to a Broaker, by strutting up to Quality; and Quality brings theirs to nothing, by striving to out-do one another. If Women were humbler, Men wou'd be honester. Pride brings Want, Want makes Rogues, Rogues come to be hang'd, and the Devil alone's the Gainer. Go your ways hone, Woman; and as your Husband maintain'd you by his Pen, maintain your self by your Needle; put your great Girls to Service; Employment will keep 'em honest; much Work, and plain Diet, will cure the Green sickness as well as a Husband. </p>

But since, if Matrimony were worn as it ought to be, it wou'd perhaps sit easier about us than <pb n="57" xml:id="ep000778-032-b"/>usually it does. I'll give you one Word of Council, and so I shall release you. </p>
            <p>When one is out of Humour, let the other be dumb. </p>
            <p>Let your Diversions be such, as both may have a share in 'em. </p>
            <p>Never let Familiarity exclude Respect. </p>

            <l>With Favours she o'rewhelm'd her Lord. </l>

The live-long Night; when all the World's at rest, consum'd in Care, and watching for their safety, when by a Whirlwind in his Fate, in spight of him, some mischief shall befall 'em, for which a furious Sentence strait shall pass, and they shall Vote him to the Scaffold.
