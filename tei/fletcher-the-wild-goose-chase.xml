              <p>Acted at court in 1621, but not printed until 1652. In 1647 when the folio of Beaumont's and Fletcher's works was published, this play was omitted, as it had long been lost and was supposed to be irrecoverable. Cf. Preface to edition of 1647; Cambridge hist. of Eng. lit.; and Dyce, A. Works of Beaumont &amp; Fletcher, 1845, v. 8, p. 102.</p>

          <salute>Noble Spirits! </salute>
        </opener>
        <p>IT will seem strange to you that we should beg a Pardon from you before you know a Crime committed; But such is our harsh Fate, that we shall want as much of your Mercie to the forgiving of this sad presumption of offering to your view these few poor sheets, the Rich Remains of our too-long-since lost Friend, Mr. FLETCHER, as we shall your favourable Acceptance, and Incouragement in it. The Play was of so Generall a receiv'd Acceptance, that (he Himself a Spectator) we have known him un-concern'd, and to have wisht it had been none of His; He, as well as the throng'd Theatre (in despight of his innate Modesty) Applauding this rare issue of his Brain. His Complacencie in his own Work, may be, perhaps no Argument to you of the Goodness of the Play, any more than our Confidence of it; and we do not expect our Encomium can do any thing with you, when the Play it self is so near: That will commend it self unto you. And now Farewell our Glory! Farewell your Choice Delight, most noble Gentlemen! Farewell th' Grand Wheel that set Vs smaller Motions in Action! Farewell the Pride and Life o'th' Stage! Nor can we (though in our Ruin) much repine that we are so little, since He that gave us being is no more. </p>
        <p>Generous Soules! </p>
        <p>'Tis not unknown unto you All, how by a cruell Destinie we have a long time been Mutes and Bound, although our Miseries have been sufficiently Clamorous and Expanded, yet till this happy opportunitie, never durst vex your open Ears and Hands: But this we're confident of will be the surest Argument for your Noblesses. What an Ingenious Person of Qualitie once spake of his Amours, we apply to our necessities, <quote>

          <head>ON Mr. FLETCHERS excellent Play, THE WILD-CHASE CHASE. </head>
          <l>ME thinkes I see thy angred ashes rise </l>
          <l>FLETCHER; I feel them smarting in my eyes. </l>
          <l>Methinks thou sayst what would this rimer have </l>
          <l>He raises me, yet gives my fame a grave?) </l>
          <l>Me thinkes (like that Old Moralist's Complaint </l>
          <l>What ill of mine has gain'd this ill mans prayse? </l>
          <l>I hear thee say, sure this Play has some taint </l>
          <l>That this ill Poet gives his withered bayes? </l>
          <l>Perhaps this good Philosophers life began </l>
          <l>To make the ill man good; As in a man </l>
          <l>To love the good's a step to being so, </l>
          <l>Love to thy Muse may be to me so too; </l>
          <l>Then I shall know how to commend thy Muse </l>
          <l>When her own self the prayses shall infuse: </l>
          <l>Till then I must sit down confess the wonder, </l>
          <l>'Bove which I cannot go, and, wont goe under. </l>
          <l>But where's the prayse (you 'I say) to FLETCHERS wit? </l>
          <l>I would ha giv'n but had no Offering fit. </l>
          <l>Then let these lines be thought to FLETCHERS Muse </l>
          <l>Not an Encomium, but an Excuse. </l>

          <l>Things to come to themselves, nor Types of Wit, </l>

          <l>When ere we read we have, and have it not, </l>
          <l>And glad to be deceiv'd, finding thy Drift </l>
          <l>T' excell our guess at every turn, and shift. </l>
          <l>Some new Meanders still do put us out, </l>
          <l>Yet find that nearest what we thought about. </l>

          <l>Which a long while we feel not, till thy Close </l>
