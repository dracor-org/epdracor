          <salute>MY LORD, </salute>
        </opener>
        <p>THIS little Off-spring of my early Muse was first Submitted to Your Lordship's Judgment, Whether it shou'd be Stifled in the Birth, or Preserv'd to try its Fortune in the World; And since 'tis from Your Sentence it has ventur'd thus far, it now Claims a sort of Title to Your Lordships Protection, which it cou'd not have the least pretence to from its own Merit; But 'tis Your Lordships Character to Encourage all great Attempts, though Unsuccessful: This was indeed a Bold one for a Woman at my Years, but I wou'd not offer my little Experience, as a reason to be Pardon'd for not acquitting my self well, (for I think the Incapacity of producing any thing better, a very ill Excuse for exposing a Foolish Thing) if the same inconsidering Youth might not excuse the rashness of the Undertaking; And I shall be much less Pardonable, if the next I bring upon the Stage has not a better Title to the Favour of the Town. This seems to promise another attempt, which shou'd not be expected from one who Conceals her Name, to shun that of Poctress. I wish I cou'd separate them here, for then I shou'd be proud to own my self to the World, with all Respect, </p>

        <lg>
          <l>ORinda, and the Fair Astrea gone, </l>
          <l>Not one was found to fill the Vacant Throne: </l>
          <l>Aspiring Man had quite regain'd the Sway, </l>
          <l>Again had Taught us humbly to Obey; </l>
          <l>Till you (Natures third start, in favour of our Kind) </l>
          <l>With stronger Arms, their Empire have disjoyn'd, </l>
          <l>And snatcht a Lawrel which they thought their Prize, </l>
          <l>Thus Conqu'ror, with your Wit, as with your Eyes. </l>
          <l>Fired by the bold Example, I would try </l>
          <l>To turn our Sexes weaker Destiny. </l>
          <l>O! How I long in the Poetick Race, </l>
          <l>To loose the Reins, and give their Glory Chase; </l>
          <l>For thus Encourag'd, and thus led by you, </l>
          <l>Methinks we might more Crowns than theirs Subdue. </l>

        <lg>
          <l>LAdies and Gallants, you we hope to find, </l>
          <l>To her, who brings you now together, kind; </l>
          <l>That you, will to your pleasing her consent, </l>
          <l>Not out of your own Nicety prevent, </l>
          <l>But to spight her, your own divertisement; </l>
          <l>And will not your Displeasure to her show, </l>
          <l>Who your scorn Ventures, but to pleasure you, </l>
          <l>Nay, her own pleasure, does for yours, forego; </l>
          <l>And like the Pregnant of her Sex, to gain, </l>
          <l>But for your pleasure, more Disgrace, and Pain; </l>
          <l>Who, but because she'd do you, a good Turn, </l>
          <l>Unask'd, unsu'd to, may become your scorn; </l>
          <l>But you, the Men of Honour, or of Wit, </l>
          <l>To set yours to a Woman can't think fit, </l>
          <l>And Ladies; as necessitous of Fame, </l>
          <l>Ne'er raise your Credit, by another's shame, </l>
          <l>Censuring others, to 'scape others blame; </l>
          <l>And Gallants; as y'are Men of Honour, you, </l>
          <l>Will ne'er speak ill, of her you do not know; </l>
          <l>The more she strives, to give you Pleasure too; </l>
          <l>Which is most often, (as we Women find,) </l>
          <l>The sole cause, you prove to us, but less kind; </l>
          <l>As well-bred Beaux's with Noise too, ne'er think fit, </l>
          <l>To silence on the Stage, as in the Pit, </l>
          <l>Another's Sense, to hide your want of Wit; </l>
          <l>But Beaux's and Wits, I pray be silent now, </l>
          <l>And hear without Noise, nay with Patience too, </l>
          <l>Our Female Wit, if you'd have her, hear you; </l>
          <l>Especially, since your own talking does, </l>
          <l>Your Pleasure interupt, your Sense Expose, </l>
          <l>Whilst Silence, good Sense, and good Breeding shows; </l>
          <l>And each Man's manners, Honour, Wit appear, </l>
          <l>More, as he's less a Woman's Censurer, </l>
          <l>Then Censures, which wou'd spoil your sport forbear: </l>
          <l>Think not the Ladies Wit, or Honour less, </l>
          <l>Because she seeks those who have less to please; </l>
          <l>Let not her Aim, to please the Publick now, </l>
          <l>Design'd her Credit, but your Scandal grow, </l>
          <l>Make not her proffer'd favour, her Disgrace, </l>
          <l>Nay, though it shou'd not please th'Intention praise, </l>
          <l>'Tis merit only, to desire to please; </l>
          <l>Then be not, as Poor Women often find, </l>
          <l>Less kind to her, but as she's more inclin'd, </l>
          <l>At venture of her Fame, to please Mankind. </l>

        <lg>
          <l>HOW strangely times are Chang'd? I'th' latter Age </l>
          <l>Prologues were fresh Complaints of Critick Rage: </l>
          <l>But now, if one Play hitts, you straight Decree </l>
          <l>To prop a Rival Muses Halting Poetry: </l>
          <l>Cou'd it but gain the Crutches of your Favour, </l>
          <l>This Tragedy might walk six days together. </l>
          <l>To day, t'incite your Charity the more, </l>
          <l>A Female Author does your Smiles implore; </l>
          <l>Not but I fear, 'tis now a thing uncommon, </l>
          <l>For Men of Wit to raise a falling Woman! </l>
          <l>Why should vain Man the Gift of Sense engross? </l>
          <l>Since Woman's Wit was never at a loss? </l>
          <l>Husbands to Wives their Whoring must Reveal, </l>
          <l>(For Unfed Passions will expect their Meal) </l>
          <l>But Womens Wits with Ease their Roving Love conceal. </l>
          <l>And Faith in spight of all the Hen-Peckt Fools can do, </l>
          <l>They've oft the Breeches worn, why not the Lawrel too! </l>
          <l>Therefore to those of undisputed Sense, </l>
          <l>Our Poetess resigns her Plays Defence. </l>
          <l>Conscious of her Faults she flies to you, </l>
          <l>To save her from the Thoughtless Damning Crew. </l>
          <l>She's Dead, if Try'd by strict Poetick Laws; </l>
          <l>But Men of Honour can't refuse a Womans Cause. </l>
          <l>Do you, the props of Wit, but seem t'approve, </l>
          <l>She cannot fear their Thunder from above: </l>
          <l>The Top must stir if the Foundation move. </l>

        <head>EPILOGUE Spoke by Mrs. Verbruggen in Mens Cloaths. </head>
        <lg>
          <l>KKnowing that Knaves and Fools are grown so plenty, (twenty, </l>
          <l>That Wise or Just are scarce found— for Rhime sake, I'll allow'em one in </l>
          <l>That few the Merits of a Cause can weigh, </l>
          <l>And those who judge aright, </l>
          <l>By hate or favour Praise or Damn a Play, </l>
          <l>That much depends upon a Poets fame, </l>
          <l>Ours a New Author and without a Name. </l>
          <l>It came into my Charitable mind, </l>
          <l>To try, if thus accouter'd, I could find </l>
          <l>The way to make you, right or wrong, be kind. </l>
          <l>A white curl'd Wig, with all the dressing Arts, </l>
          <l>Must needs engage the Ladies tender Hearts; </l>
          <l>And for the Men </l>
          <l>Petticoats seem the properest bait no doubt; </l>
          <l>Yet you must own you like us best without; </l>
          <l>But if that Jest's too weak to catch your Grace, </l>
          <l>With a cock'd Hat and a stern blustring Face, </l>
          <l>I'll try to Bully you into good Nature, </l>
          <l>And bid defiance to your Coward Satyr; </l>
          <l>That meanly wou'd a Womans strength oppose, </l>
          <l>Wou'd I'ad put on your Courage with your Cloaths. </l>
          <l>I fear these Breeches, Sword, and Manly shew </l>
          <l>Ev'ry way promise more than I can do: </l>
          <l>I find my Female Heart begins to fail, </l>
          <l>And now cou'd condescend (if 'twou'd prevail) </l>
          <l>To beg your Votes but what can that avail. </l>
          <l>After these brags 'twould make you but despise me, </l>
          <l>For your own Interest than let me advise ye. </l>
          <l>Doom not our Author's first Essay to fall, </l>
          <l>For fear, her Eyes revenge it on you all. </l>
          <l>For heark ye, among Friends— 'tis whisper'd here. </l>
          <l>Our Poetess is Virtuous, Young, and Fair; </l>
          <l>But that first Epithet I must leave out, </l>
          <l>'Twill please but very few of you, I doubt. </l>
          <l>Then let it pass; Yet sure not nam'd in vain, </l>
          <l>For Virtue must that shining Circle gain; </l>
          <l>Her other Charms may captivate the rest, </l>
          <l>Each fancying her what form wou'd please him best. </l>
          <l>But stay, I fear this airy bribe won't move, </l>
          <l>You are not made for dull Platonick Love. </l>
          <l>Well, we may hope in time she'll more disclose, </l>
          <l>That's if you like what here at first she shows. </l>
          <l>Applaud her then, for Curiosity, </l>
          <l>She only sculks to be from Censure free; </l>
          <l>Admire her strength of Judgment, praise her Wit, </l>
          <l>And croud each Night the Boxes and the Pit: </l>
          <l>Pufft up with her success, she'll soon appear, </l>
          <l>And lay aside her Modesty and Fear, </l>
          <l>Which Women oft have parted with for you, </l>
          <l>But to dear Vanity they're always true. </l>
