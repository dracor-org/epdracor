        <head>To my singular honest Stationer, Mr. Robert Mylbourne, at his shop in decimo sexto, by the south doore of Pauls. </head>
        <p>AS you are a true Booke-seller, you must approue your selfe a true Booke-restorer: and therfore by booke or by crooke, see that you send backe my Book. And yet not my Booke. For it was but a borrowed Booke, for which my promise and credit lye in mortgage to the Author, the Schoolemaster of Hadley, who with some difficulty lent it me, hauing no other coppy of this English Lesson which. he prepared for a By-exercise for his schollars at the last Carneual. He told me that hee huddled it vp in hast, and that it being onely an essay of his owne faculty, and of the actiuity of his tenderlings, he was loath it should come vnder <pb xml:id="ep000052-003-a"/>any other eye, then of those Parents and domestique friends who fauourably beheld it, when it was represented by the children. And therefore, I must be, and am tender of suffering it to wander I know not whither, by the out let of your friends hand: whom as I know not, so I cannot challenge of any trust; but require restitution of you, as the Author doth of me. So, expecting without delay, the returne of this bird into the cage, I end with a threat, that if you faile, you must looke to haue this Comedy turned into a Tragedy, and, for detaining this booke, to haue your name set on the backe side of my booke. Whereto I adde yet a deeper curse, that next time you meet with good fellowes in Epping Forrest, you may not be so happy, as to feed them with nuts in stead of money. </p>

        </opener>
        <p>I pray you extend your loue so farre to your friend, and your friends friend, as to thinke that neither the first will defraud you of your borrowed Booke, nor the second expose the Author to any inconuenience. The truth is my friend, vpon the sight of this Morall, Scholasticall, Theatricall Treatise, protested that the Author should receiue much right in being thus wronged; and vpon sufficient bond vndertooke to saue me harmelesse if I made it more publique then euer was intended. And withall hee armed me with a legall defence, that, if I restored tenne sold for the principall, the Author (notwithstanding his modesty) could frame no iust quarrell against me or you at the barre of iustice <pb xml:id="ep000052-004-a"/>or reputation. Accordingly he incouraged me (if Master Schoolemaster of Hadley should schoole you for promise-breach) to stop his mouth with a dozen of chicken hatcht vnder his owne henne. </p>
        <p>I pray you therefore in stead of his owne single written Coppy, coppy him with this packet of his owne mettall stamped and multiplied by the Printers Alchimy. </p>
        <p>The worst I heare, is, that hee will complaine to Apollo of me that I haue proclaimed abroad his priuate Shrouing. For which I haue a defence from the Authors owne penne, that Apollos solemne visitation begins with Proclamation. Act. 1. Scen. ultima And, I trow Proclamations are intended to flye abroad in print. So in hope that I shall receiue, if not thanks, yet pardon from him. I rather take, then begge, leaue to remaine still </p>

There sore he misses me, and sayes vnto himselfe. Where is my Amphibius? Why keepes he not his accuostomed houre? What, shall I after Philoponus into the temple? <pb n="11" xml:id="ep000052-009-b"/>'Tis with the latest now. And (to confesse the truth) alas I dare not there appeare to present my selfe before Apollos Altar. Nor haue I now the boldnesse to looke my deare Philoponus in the face. His setled countenance and graue gesture giue a cheeke vnto my leuity. His very silence reades vnto mee a lecture of reprehension. My passions so deepe inthrald another way, bid mee now rather to withdraw from such society, and hide my selfe in shades and groues, and solitude. </p>
              <p>Alas Amphibius, though hauing tide himselfe to the mast of safety by the bonds of temperance, yet breaketh loose, and leapes into the sea of danger. Alas hee cannot hold. This Sirens song is so attractiue. I yeeld, I come And yet how can I? shall I runne away from the worthy trade whereto I am bound apprentise? My name is inrold in Apollos register, and shall I rase it out, and be reckoned among the fugitiues and renegados? Not so. And yet and yet it will be so. O how my very booke seemes now a burthen vnto me, and that which heretofore did eleuate my soule, and giue it wings to flye aloft, sweet contemplation of nature and of arts, that now alas layes on me the heauy load of vpbraiding, I flye, I flye, I hast into the by waies of these thickest groues </p>

              <p>What will he thus leaue me alone? And yet euen thus alone I am not. Nunquam minus solus quam cum solus. My bookes and meditations are my companions, that neuer faile me. With me they walke and talke, with them I rest at home: and other while when I trauell abroad and conuerse with contemplation, how short and easie are the wayes? yea, and how safe too? I can feare no the eues: the Muses are my guard. And in very truth, what can the eues rob me of? My purse is light, and so my heart. My true riches treasured vp in the cabinet of this breast, no lurching hand by stealth, no robbing rouer by force can seise vpon. My Father hath no land to leaue me. I thinke his meane estate is the better meanes of my happinesse. This education which he affoords me, I take for a more goodly and durable inheritance, then if he could haue left mee thousands of stockes and acres, without any bringing vp in qualitie other then the gentle vanities of the times. </p>

O the diuine power of vnbred conscience? Sutable to this is that of Seneca. Quid prodest non habere conscium habenti conscientiam? When Amphibius and I discoursed on this point at our priuate reading of Seneca, I remember how affectionately he would take the booke into his bosome, and hugge it, and protest that this one sentence is able to make vs honest men.

              <p>Yes to thee. Mutato nomine de te Fabula narratur. Thou art this new come guest, gazing on and admiring the varnisht wares, set out in the deceitfull shop of Hedone. She cuts out and tackes together, large declamations in folio. In laudem voluptatis. These shee sends abroad by the end of her Broaker Siren: Who, loaden with these blanke letters, rambles vp &amp; down: and, when she lights vpon any credulous soule, presently she addes an indorcement, and makes the receiuer beleeue that Queene Hedone her selfe doth wooe him. Against the concourse of this solemne day this Siren, houering here for gaine, now seiseth on thee. And thou beleeuest that this paper garment was cut out and sow'd and lac'd for Amphibius. If shee meete with me, verily I shall haue another the same letter, indorced, To her deare, her onely deare Philoponus. Then shall I bee the flowre of youth, and what not? </p>

        <p>The textual notes below aim at making textual corrections readable in their immediate context and facilitating access to the source text. A five-digit number preceded by 'A' or 'B' represents an EEBO-TCP filenumber. A notation like "6-b-2890" means "look for EEBO page image 6 of that text, word 289 on the right side of the double-page image." That reference is followed by the corrupt reading. A black dot stands for an unidentified letter, a black square for an unidentified punctuation mark, a diamond for a missing word, and the ellipsis for a short span of undefined length. The corrected reading is displayed as a keyword in context.</p>
