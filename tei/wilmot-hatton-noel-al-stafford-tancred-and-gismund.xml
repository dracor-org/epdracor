        <head>¶ To the right Worshipfull and vertuous Ladies, the L. Anne Graie, &amp; the Ladie Marie Peter, long health of bodie, with quiet of minde, in the fauor of God and men for euer. </head>
        <p>IT is most certaine (right vertuous and wershipfull) that of all humane learning, Poetrie (how contemptible so euer it is in these daies, is the most ancient) and in Poetrie, there is no argument of more antiquitie and elegancie than is the matter of Loue; for it seemes to be as old as the world, &amp; to beare date from the first time that man &amp; woman was: therfore in this, as in the finest mettall, the freshest wits haue in all ages shown their best workmanship. So amongst others these Gentlemen, which with what sweetnesse of voice and liuelinesse of action they then expressed it, they which were of her Maiesties right Honorable maidens can testifie. </p>
        <p>Which being a discourse of two louers, perhappes it may seeme a thing neither fit to be offered vnto your Ladyships, nor worthie me to busie my selfe withall: yet can I tell you Madames, it differeth so farre from the ordinarie amorous discourses of our daies, as the manners of our time do from the modestic and innocencie of that age. </p>
        <p>And now for that wearie winter is come vpon vs, which bringeth with him drouping daies and tedious nights, if it be true, that the motions of our mindes follow the temperature of the aire wherein we liue, then I thinke, the perusing of some mournfull matter, tending to the view of a notable example, will refresh your wits in a gloomie day, &amp; ease your wearines of the louring night. Which if it please you <pb xml:id="ep000307-003-a"/>serue ye also for a solemne reuell against this Festiuall time, for Gismunds bloudie shadow, with a little cost, may be intreated in her self-like person to speake to ye. </p>
        <p>Hauing therfore a desire to be knowen to your W I deuised this waie with my selfe to procure the same, persuading my selfe, there is nothing more welcome to your wisedomes, then the knowledge of wise, graue, &amp; worthie matters, tending to the good instructions of youths, of whom you are mothers. </p>
        <p>In this respect therefore, I shall humblie desire ye to bestow a fauour able countenance vpon this little labor, which when ye haue graced it withall, I must &amp; will acknowledge my selfe greatly indebted vnto your Ladyships in this behalfe: neither shall I amongst the rest, that admire your rare vertues, (which are not a fewe in Essex) cease to commend this vndeserued gentlenes. </p>
        <p>Thus desiring the king of heauen to increase his graces in ye both, granting that your ends may be as honorable, as your liues are vertuous, I leaue with a vaine babble of many needlesse wordes to trouble you longer. </p>

        <head>To his frend R. W. </head>
        <p>Master R: W. looke not now for the tears of an intreator, I wil beg no longer, and for your promises, I wil refuse them as bad paiment: neither can I be satisfied with any thing, but a peremptorie performance of an old intention of yours, the publishing I meane of those wast papers (as it pleaseth you to cal them, but as I esteem them, a most exquisite inuention) of Gismunds Tragedie. Thinke not to shift me off with longer delayes, nor alledge more excuses to get further respite, least I arrest you with my Actum est, and commence such a sute of vnkindenesse against you, as when the case shalbe scand before the Judges of courtesie, the court wil crie out of your immoderat modestie. And thus much I tel you before, you shal not be able to wage against me in the charges growing vpon this action, especially, if the worshipful company of the Inner temple gentlemen patronize my cause, as vndoubtedly they wil, yea, &amp; rather plead partially for me then let my cause miscary, because themselues are parties. The tragedie was by them most pithely framed, and no lesse curiously acted in view of her Maiesty, by whom it was then as princely accepted, as of the whole honorable audience notably applauded: yea, and of al men generally desired, as a work, either in statelines of shew, depth of conceit, or true ornaments of poeticall arte, inferior to none of the best in that kinde: no, were the Roman Seneca the censurer. The braue youths that then (to their high praises) so feelingly performed the same in action, did shortly after lay vp the looke vnregarded, or perhaps let it run abroade (as many parentes doe their children once past dandling) not respecting so much what hard fortune might befall it being out of their angers, as how their heroical wits might againe be quickly conceiued with new inuentions of like worthines, wherof they haue been euer since wonderfull fertill. But this orphan of theirs (for he wandreth as it were fatherlesse) hath notwithstanding, by the rare &amp; bewtiful perfections <pb xml:id="ep000307-004-a"/>appearing in him, hetherto neuer wanted great fauourers, and louing preseruers. Among whom I cannot sufficiently commend your more then charitable zeale, and scholerly compassion towards him, that haue not only rescued and defended him from the deuouring iawes of obliuion, but vouchsafed also to apparrel him in a new sute at your own charges, wherin he may again more boldly come abroad, and by your permission returne to his olde parents, clothed perhaps not in richer or more costly furniture then it went from them, but in handsomnes &amp; fashion more answerable to these times, wherein fashions are so often altered. Let one word suffice for your encouragement herein: namely, that your commendable pains in disrobing him of his antike curiositie, and adorning him with the approoued guise of our stateliest Englishe termes (not diminishing, but more augmenting his artificiall colours of absolute poesie, deriued from his first parents) cannot but bee grateful to most mens appetites, who vpon our experience we know highly to esteem such lofty measures of sententiously composed Tragedies. </p>
        <p>How much you shal make me, and the rest of your priuate frends beholding vnto you, I list not to discourse: and therfore grounding vpon these alledged reasons, that the suppressing of this Tragedie, so worthy for that presse, were no other thing then wilfully to defraud your selfe of an vniuersall thank, your frends of their expectations, and sweete G. of a famous eternitie. I will cease to doubt of any other pretence to cloake your bashfulnesse, hoping to read it in print (which lately lay neglected amongst your papers) at our next appointed meeting. </p>
        <p>I bid you heartely farewell. From Pyrge in 〈◊〉, August the eight, 1591. </p>

        <head>TO THE WORSHIP FVLL AND learned Societie, the Gentlemen Students of the Inner Temple, with the rest of his singular good friends, the Gentlemen of the middle Temple, and to all other curteous readers, R. W. wisheth increase of all health, worship &amp; learning, with the immortall glorie of the graces adorning the same. </head>
        <p>YE may perceiue (right Worshipful) in perusing the former Epistle sent to mee, how sore I am beset with the importunities of my friends, to publish this Pamphlet: Truly I am and haue bin (if there be in me anie soundnes of iudgement) of this opinion, that whatsoeuer is committed to the presse is commended to eternitie, and it shall stand a liuely witnes with our conscience, to our comfort or confusion, in the reckning of that great daie. </p>
        <p>Aduisedly therefore was that Prouerbe vsed of our elder Philosophers, Manum a Tabula: with-hold thy hand from the paper, and thy papers from the print or light of the world: for a lewd word escaped is irreuocable, but a bad or base discourse published in print is intollerable. </p>
        <p>Hereupon I haue indured some conflicts between reason and iudgement, whether it were conuenient for the common wealth, with the indecorum of my calling (as some thinke it) that the memorie of Tancreds Tragedie should be againe by my meanes, reuiued, which the oftner I read ouer, and the more I considered theron, the sooner I was won to consent therunto: calling to mind that neither the thrice reuerend &amp; lerned father M. Beza, was ashamed in his yonger yeres, to send abroad in his owne name, his <pb xml:id="ep000307-005-a"/>Tragedy of Abraham, nor that rare Scot (the scholer of our age) Buchanan, his most pathetical Ieptha. </p>
        <p>Indeed I must willingly confesse this worke simple, and not worth comparison to any of theirs: for the writers of them were graue men; of this, young heads: In them is shewn the perfection of their studies; in this, the imperfection of their wits. Neuertheles herein they al agree, commending vertue, detesting vice, and liuely deciphering their ouerthrow that suppresse not their vnruely affections. These things noted herin, how simple so euer the verse be, I hope the matter wil be acceptable to the wise. </p>
        <p>Wherefore I am now bold to present Gismund to your sights, and vnto yours only, for therfore haue I coniured her, by the loue that hath bin these 24. yeres betwixt vs, that she waxe not so proude of her fresh painting, to stragle in her plumes abroad, but to contein her selfe within the walles of your house; so am I sure she shalbe safe from the Tragedian Tyrants of our time, who are not ashamed to affirme that ther can no amarous poeme sauour of any sharpnes of wit, vnlesse it be seasoned with scurrilous words. </p>
        <p>But leauing them to their lewdnes, I hope you, &amp; all discreet readers, wil thankfully receiue my pains, the fruites of my first haruest: the rather, perceiuing that my purpose in this Tragedie, tendeth onely to the exaltation of vertue, &amp; suppression of vice, with pleasure to profit and help al men, but to offend, or hurt no man. As for such as haue neither the grace, nor the good gift to doe well themselues, nor the common honestie, to speak wel of others, I must (as I may) heare and bear their baitings with patience. </p>

          <p>TANCRED king of Naples and Prince of Salerne, gaue his only daughter Gismund (whom he most dearely loued) in mariage to a foraine Prince, after whose death she returned home to her Father, who hauing felt great griefe of hir absence whilst her husband liued, immesurably esteeming her, determined neuer to suffer any second mariage to bereaue him of hir She on the other side waxing wearie of that her fathers purpose, bent hir mind to the secret loue of the County Palurin: to whom (he being likewise inflamed with loue of her) by a Letter subtilly inclosed in a clouen cane, she gaue to vnderstand a conuenient waie for their desired meetings, through an old ruinous vaut, whose mouth opened directly vnder her chamber floore. Into this vaut when she was one day descended (for the conuaiance of hir louer) hir father in the meane season (whose only ioy was in his daughter) came to hir chamber, and not finding her there, supposing her to haue bin walked abroad for hir disport, he threw him downe on hir bed, and couered his head with a curtain, minding to abide and rest there till hir returne. She nothing suspecting this hir fathers vnseasonable comming, brought vp hir louer out of the cane into hir chamber, where hir father espied their secret loue: and hee (not espied of them) was vpon this sight striken with meruailous griefe; but either for that the sodaine despight had amazed him, &amp; taken from him all vse of speech, or for that he resolued himself to a more conuenient reuenge, he then spake nothing, but noted their returne into the vant, and secretly <pb xml:id="ep000307-007-a"/>departed. Afterward bewailing his mishap, be commanded the Earle to be attached, imprisoned, strangled, vnbowelled, and his heart in a cup of golde to be presented to his daughter: she thankefully receiueth the present, filling the cuppe (wherein the heart was) with her teares, with a vonimcus potion (by her distilled for that purpose) shee dranke to her Earle. Which her father hearing of, came too late to comfort his dying daughter, who for her last request besought him, that her louer and her selfe, might in one tombe be together buried, for a perpetuall memorie of their faithfull loues, which request he graunted, adding to the buriall, himselfe slaine with his owne hands, to his owne reproch, and the terror of all other hard hearted fathers. </p>

                <l>Of present death, then he whom neuer dread </l>

                <l>He praid therfore that we would make report </l>
                <l>To her of those his last words he would say: </l>
                <l>That though he neuer could in any sort </l>
                <l>Her gentlenes requite, nor neuer lay </l>
                <l>Within his power to serue her as he would, </l>
                <l>Yet she possest his heart with hand and might, </l>
                <l>To doe her all the honor that he could. </l>
                <l>This was to him of all the ioyes that might </l>
                <l>Reuiue his heart, the chiefest ioy of al, </l>
                <l>That, to declare the faithfull heart which he </l>
                <l>Did beare to her, fortune so wel did fall, </l>
                <l>That in her loue he should both liue and die. </l>
                <l>After these words he staid, and spake no more, </l>
                <l>But ioyfully beholding vs each one, </l>
                <l>His words and cheare amazed vs so sore </l>
                <l>That stil we stoode: when forthwith thereupon </l>
                <l>But why slack you (quoth he) to do the thing </l>
                <l>For which you come? make speed and stay no more </l>
                <l>Performe your masters will: now tel the king </l>
                <l>He hath his life for which he long'd so sore: </l>
                <l>And with those words himselfe with his own hand </l>
                <l>Fastned the bands about his neck. The rest </l>
                <l>Wondring at his stout heart, astonied stand </l>

        <p>The textual notes below aim at making textual corrections readable in their immediate context and facilitating access to the source text. A five-digit number preceded by 'A' or 'B' represents an EEBO-TCP filenumber. A notation like "6-b-2890" means "look for EEBO page image 6 of that text, word 289 on the right side of the double-page image." That reference is followed by the corrupt reading. A black dot stands for an unidentified letter, a black square for an unidentified punctuation mark, a diamond for a missing word, and the ellipsis for a short span of undefined length. The corrected reading is displayed as a keyword in context.</p>
