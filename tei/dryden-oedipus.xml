        <head>PREFACE. </head>
        <p>THOUGH it be dangerous to raise too great an expectation, especially in works of this Nature, where we are to please an unsatiable Audience, yet 'tis reasonable to prepossess them in favour of an Author, and therefore both the Prologue and Epilogue inform'd you, that Oedipus was the most celebrated piece of all Antiquity. That Sophocles, not only the greatest Wit, but one of the greatest Men in Athens, made it for the Stage at the Publick Cost, and that it had the reputation of being his Master-piece, not only amongst the Seven of his which are still remaining, but of the greater Number which are perish'd. Aristole has more than once admir'd it in his Book of Poetry, Horace has mention'd it: <hi>Lucullus, Julius Caesar</hi>, and other noble Romans, have written on the same Subject, though their Poems are wholly lost; but Seneca's is still preserv'd. In our own Age, Corneille has attempted it, and it appears by his Preface, with great success: But a judicious Reader will easily observe, how much the Copy is inferiour to the Original. He tells you himself, that he owes a great part of his success to the happy Episode of Theseus and Dirce; which is the same thing, as if we should acknowledge, that we were indebted for our good fortune, to the under-plot of <hi>Adrastus, Eurydice</hi>, and Creon. The truth is, he <pb xml:id="ep000529-003-a"/>miserably fail'd in the Character of his Hero: if he desir'd that Oedipus should be pitied, he shou'd have made him a better man. He forgot that Sophocles had taken care to shew him in his first entrance, a just, a merciful, a successful, a Religious Prince, and in short, a Father of his Country: instead of these, he has drawn him suspicious, designing, more anxious of keeping the Theban Crown, than solicitous for the safety of his People: Hector'd by Theseus, contemn'd by Dirce, and scarce maintaining a second part in his own Tragedie. This was an errour in the first concoction; and therefore never to be mended in the second or the third: He introduc'd a greater Heroe than Oedipus himself: for when Theseus was once there, that Companion of Hercules must yield to none: The Poet was oblig'd to furnish him with business, to make him an Equipage suitable to his dignity, and by following him too close, to lose his other King of Branford in the Crowd. Seneca on the other side, as if there were no such thing as Nature to be minded in a Play, is always running after pompous expression, pointed sentences, and Philosophical notions, more proper for the Study than the Stage: The French-man follow'd a wrong scent; and the Roman was absolutely at cold Hunting. All we cou'd gather out of Corneille, was, that an Episode must be, but not his way: and Seneca supply'd us with no new hint, but only a Relation which he makes of his Tiresias raising the Ghost of Lajus: which is here perform'd in view of the Audience, the Rites and Ceremonies so far his, as he agreed with Antiquity, and the Religion of the Greeks: but he himself was beholding to Homer's Tiresias in the Odysses for some of them: and the rest have been collected from <hi>Heliodore's, AEthiopiques</hi>, and <hi>Lucan's Erictho. Sophocles </hi>indeed is <pb xml:id="ep000529-003-b"/>admirable every where: And therefore we have follow'd him as close as possibly we cou'd: But the Athenian Theater, (whether more perfect than ours is not now disputed) had a perfection differing from ours. You see there in every Act a single Scene, (or two at most) which manage the business of the Play, and after that succeeds the Chorus, which commonly takes up more time in Singing, than there has been employ'd in speaking. The Principal person appears almost constantly through the Play; but the inferiour parts seldome above once in the whole Tragedie. The conduct of our Stage is much more difficult, where we are oblig'd never to lose any considerable character which we have once presented. Custom likewise has obtain'd, that we must form an under-plot of second Persons, which must be depending on the first, and their by-walks must be like those in a Labyrinth, which all of 'em-lead into the great Parterre: or like so many several lodging Chambers, which have their out-lets into the same Gallery. Perhaps after all, if we could think so, the ancient method, as 'tis the easiest, is also the most Natural, and the best. For variety, as 'tis manag'd, is too often subject to breed distraction: and while we would please too many ways, for want of art in the conduct, we please in none. But we have given you more already than was necessary for a Preface, and for ought we know, may gain no more by our instructions, than that Politick Naton is like to do, who have taught their Enemies to fight so long, that at last they are in a condition to invade them. </p>

        <head>PROLOGUE. </head>
        <l>WHEN Athens all the Graecian State did guide, </l>
        <l>And Greece gave Laws to all the World beside, </l>
        <l>Then Sophocles with Socrates did sit, </l>
        <l>Supreme in Wisdom one, and one in Wit: </l>
        <l>And Wit from Wisdom differ'd not in those, </l>
        <l>But as 'twas Sung inVerse, or said in Prose. </l>
        <l>Then, Oedipus, on Crowded Theaters, </l>
        <l>Drew all admiring Eyes and listning Ears; </l>
        <l>The pleas'd Spectator shouted every Line, </l>
        <l>The noblest, manliest, and the best Design! </l>
        <l>And every Critick of each learned Age </l>
        <l>By this just Model has reform'd the Stage. </l>
        <l>Now, should it fail, (as Heav'n avert our fear!) </l>
        <l>Damn it in silence, lest the World should hear. </l>
        <l>For were it known this Poem did not please, </l>
        <l>You might set up for perfect Salvages: </l>
        <l>Your Neighbours would not look on you as men: </l>
        <l>But think the Nation all turn'd Picts agen. </l>
        <l>Faith, as you manage matters, 'tis not fit </l>
        <l>You should suspect your selves of too much Wit. </l>
        <l>Drive not the jeast too far, but spare this piece; </l>
        <l>And, for this once, be not more Wise than Greece. </l>
        <pb xml:id="ep000529-005-a"/>
        <l>See twice! Do not pell-mell to Damning fall, </l>
        <l>Like true born Brittains, who ne're think at all: </l>
        <l>Pray be advis'd; and though at Mons you won, </l>
        <l>On pointed Cannon do not always run. </l>
        <l>With some respect to antient Wit proceed; </l>
        <l>You take the four first Councils for your Creed. </l>
        <l>But, when you lay Tradition wholly by, </l>
        <l>And on the private Spirit alone relye, </l>
        <l>You turn Fanaticks in your Poetry. </l>
        <l>If, notwithstanding all that we can say, </l>
        <l>You needs will have your pen'worths of the Play: </l>
        <l>And come resolv'd to Damn, because you pay, </l>
        <l>Record it, in memorial of the Fact, </l>
        <l>The first Play bury'd since the Wollen Act. </l>

        <head>EPILOGUE. </head>
        <l>WHAT Sophocles could undertake alone, </l>
        <l>Our Poets found a Work for more than one; </l>
        <l>And therefore Two lay tugging at the piece, </l>
        <l>With all their force, to draw the pondrous Mass from Greece. </l>
        <l>A weight that bent ev'n Seneca's strong Muse, </l>
        <l>And which Corneille's Shoulders did refuse. </l>
        <l>So hard it is th' Athenian Harp to string! </l>
        <l>So much two Consuls yield to one just King. </l>
        <l>Terrour and pity this whole Poem sway; </l>
        <l>The mightiest Machines that can mount a Play; </l>
        <l>How heavy will those Vulgar Souls be found, </l>
        <l>Whom two such Engines cannot move from ground? </l>
        <l>When Greece and Rome have smil'd upon this Birth, </l>
        <l>You can but Damn for one poor spot of Earth; </l>
        <l>And when your Children find your judgment such, </l>
        <l>They'll scorn their Sires, and wish themselves born Dutch; </l>
        <l>Each haughty Poet will infer with ease, </l>
        <l>How much his Wit must under-write to please. </l>
        <l>As some strong Churle would brandishing advance </l>
        <l>The monumental Sword that conquer'd France; </l>
        <l>So you, by judging this, your judgments teach </l>
        <l>Thus far you like, that is, thus far you reach. </l>
        <pb xml:id="ep000529-045-a"/>
        <l>Since then the Vote of full two Thousand years </l>
        <l>Has Crown'd this Plot, and all the Dead are theirs. </l>
        <l>Think it a Debt you pay, not Alms you give, </l>
        <l>And in your own defence, let this Play live. </l>
        <l>Think 'em not vain, when Sophocles is shown, </l>
        <l>To praise his worth, they humbly doubt their own. </l>
        <l>Yet as weak States each others pow'r assure, </l>
        <l>Weak Poets by Conjunction are secure. </l>
        <l>Their Treat is what your Pallats rellish most, </l>
        <l>Charm! Song! and Show! a Murder and a Ghost! </l>
        <l>We know not what you can desire or hope, </l>
        <l>To please you more, but burning of a Pope. </l>
