        <head>THE ARGVMENT. </head>
        <p>THe Lord FRAMPVL, a noble Gentleman, well educated, and bred a Schollar, in Oxford, was married yong, to a vertuous Gentlewoman, Sylly's daughter of the South, whose worth (though he truly enioy'd) hee neuer could rightly value; but, as many greene Husbands (giuen ouer to their extrauagant delights, and some peccant humors of their owne) occasion'd in his ouer louing wife, so deepe a melancholy, by his leauing her in the time of her lying in, of her second daughter, shee hauing <pb xml:id="ep000113-005-b"/>brought him only two daughters, Frances, and Laetitia: and (out of her hurt fancy) interpreting that to bee a cause of her husbands couldnesse in affection, her not being blest with a sonne, tooke a resolution with her selfe, after her months time, and thanksgiuing ritely in the Church, to quit her home, with a vow neuer to returne, till by reducing her Lord, she could bring a wish'd happinesse to the family. </p>
        <p>He, in the meane time returning, and hearing of this departure of his Lady, began, though ouer-late, to resent the iniury he had done her: and out of his cockbraind resolution, entred into as solemne a quest of her. Since when, neither of them had beene heard of. But the eldest daughter Frances, by the title of Lady Frampul, enioyed the state, her sister being lost yong, and is the sole relict of the family. </p>

          <p>This Lady, being a braue, bountifull Lady, and enioying this free, and plentifull estate, hath an ambitious disposition to be esteemed the Mistresse of many seruants, but loues none. And hearing of a famous new-Inne, that is kept by a merry Host, call'd Good-stock, in Barnet, inuites some Lords, and Gentlemen to wait on her thither, as well to see the fashions of the place, as to make themselues merry, with the accidents on the by. It happens, there is a melancholique Gentleman, one Master Lovel, hath beene lodg'd there some dayes before in the Inne, who (vnwilling to be seene) is surpriz'd by the Lady, and inuited by Prudence, the Ladies Chamber-maid, who is <pb xml:id="ep000113-006-b"/>elected Gouernesse of the Sports, in the Inne, for that day, and instal'd their Soueraigne Lovel is perswaded by the Host, and yeelds to the Ladies inuitation, which concludes the first Act.

But, hee failing of his word, the Lady had commanded a standard of her owne best apparrell to bee brought downe: and Prudence is so fitted. The Lady being put in mind, that shee is there alone without other company of women, borrowes (by the aduice of Pru) the Hosts sonne of the house, whom they <pb xml:id="ep000113-007-a"/>dresse with the Hosts consent, like a Lady, and send out the Coachman, with the empty Coach, as for a kinswoman of her Ladiships, Mistresse Laetitia Sylly, to beare her company: Who attended with his Nurse, an old chare-woman in the Inne, drest odly by the Hosts councell, is beleeued to be a Lady of quality, and so receiu'd, entertain'd, and loue made to her, by the yong Lord Beaufort, &amp;c: In the meane time, the Fly of the Inne is discouer'd to Colonell Glorious, with the Militia of the house, below the stayres, in the Drawer, Tapster, Chamberlaine, and Hostler, inferiour officers, with the Coachman Trundle, Ferret, &amp;c.

To whom, hee first by definition, and after by argument answeres, prouing, and describing the effects. of Loue, so vively, as she, who had derided the name of Loue before, hearing his discourse, is now so taken both with the Man, and his matter, as shee confesseth her selfe enamour'd of him, and, but for the ambition shee hath to enioy the other houre, had presently <pb xml:id="ep000113-008-a"/>declar'd her selfe: which giues both him, and the spectators occasion to thinke she yet dissembles, notwithstanding the payment of her kisse, which hee celebrates.

They are both condem'd, and censur'd, shee stript like a Doxey, and sent home a foote. In the interim, the second houre goes on, and the question, at sute of the Lady Frampul, is chang'd from loue to valour; which ended, he receiues his second kisse, and by the rigor of the Soueraigne, fals into a fit of melancholy, worse, or more desperate then the first. </p>
          <p>The fifth, and last Act is the Catastrophe, or knitting vp of all, where Fly <pb xml:id="ep000113-009-a"/>brings word to the Host, of the Lord Beauforts being married priuately in the new stable, to the suppos'd Lady, his sonne; which the Host receiues as an omen of mirth.

The Host encounters them, with this relation of L. Beauforts mariage, which is seconded by the L. Latimer, and all the seruants of the house. In this while, L. Beaufort comes in, and professes it, calls for his bed, and bride-bowle, to be made ready, the Host forbids both, shewes whom hee hath married, and discouers him to be his sonne, a boy. The Lord Bridegrome confounded, the Nurse enters like a franticke bedlem, cries out on Flie, sayes shee is vndone, in her daughter, who is confessed to <pb xml:id="ep000113-009-b"/>be the Lord Frampuls child, sister to the other Lady, the Host to be their Father.

        <p>Nurse. A poore chare-woman in the Inne, with one eye, that tends the boy, is thought the Irish begger that sold him, but is truly the Lady Frampul; who left her home melancholique, and iealous that her Lord lou'd her not, because she brought him none but daughters, and liues, vnknowne to her husband, as he to her. </p>
        <p>Frances. Supposed the Lady Frampul, being reputed his sole daughter, and heire, the Barony descending vpon her, is a Lady of great fortunes, and beauty, but phantasticall: thinks nothing a felicity, but to haue a multitude of seruants, and be call'd Mistresse by them, comes to the Inne to <pb xml:id="ep000113-011-a"/>be merry, with a Chambermaid only, and her Seruants her ghests, &amp;c. </p>
        <p>Prudence. The Chamber-maid, is elected Soueraigne of the Sports in the Inne, gouernes all, commands, and so orders, as the Lord Latimer is exceedingly taken with her, and takes her to his wife, in conclusion. </p>
        <p>Lord Latimer and Lord Beaufort, are a paire of yong Lords, seruants and ghests to the Lady Frampul, but as Latimer fall's enamour'd of Prudence, so doth Beaufort on the boy, the Hosts sonne, set vp for Laetitia, the yonger sister, which shee prooues to bee indeed. </p>
        <p>Sir Glorious Tipto. A Knight, and Colonell, hath the luck to thinke well of himselfe, without a riuall, talkes gloriously of any thing, but very seldome is in the right. He is the Ladies ghest, and her seruant too; but this day vtterly neglects his seruice, or that him. For he is so enamour'd on the Fly of the Inne, and the Militia below stayres, with Hodge Huffle, and Bat: Burst, ghests that come in, and Trundle, Barnabe, &amp;c. as no other society relisheth with him. </p>

          <l>Be seru'd in, i'the time, and to your wish: </l>
          <l>If any thing be set to a wrong taste, </l>
          <l>'Tis not the meat, there, but the mouth's displac'd, </l>
          <l>Remoue but that sick palat, all is well. </l>
          <l>For this, the secure dresser badd me tell, </l>
          <l>Nothing more hurts iust meetings, then a croud; </l>
          <l>Or, when the expectation's growne too loud: </l>
          <l>That the nice stomack, would ha' this or that, </l>
          <l>And being ask'd, or vrg'd, it knowes not what: </l>
          <l>When sharpe, or sweet, haue beene too much a feast, </l>
          <l>And both out liu'd the palate of the ghest. </l>
          <l>Beware to bring such appetites to the stage, </l>
          <l>They doe confesse a weake, sick, queasie age, </l>
          <l>And a shrew'd grudging too of ignorance, </l>
          <l>When clothes and faces 'boue the men aduance: </l>
          <l>Heare for your health, then, But at any hand, </l>
          <l>Before you iudge, vouchsafe to vnderstand, </l>

          <l>Yet iudgement would the last be, i the field, </l>
          <l>With a true Poet. He could haue hal'd in </l>
          <l>The drunkards, and the noyses of the Inne, </l>
          <l>In his last Act; if he had thought it fit </l>
          <l>To vent you vapours, in the place of wit: </l>
          <l>But better 'twas, that they should sleepe, or spew, </l>
          <l>Then in the Scene to offend or him, or you. </l>
          <l>This he did thinke; and this doe you forgiue: </l>
          <l>When ere the carcasse dies, this Art will liue. </l>
          <l>And had he liu'd the care of King, and Queene, </l>
          <l>His Art in somthing more yet had beene seene; </l>
          <l>But Maiors, and Shriffes may yearely fill the stage: </l>
