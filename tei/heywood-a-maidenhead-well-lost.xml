        <head>To the Reader. </head>
        <p>COurteous Reader, (of what sexe soeuer) let not the Title of this Play any way deterre thee from the perusall thereof: For there is nothing herein contained, which doth deuiate either from Modesty, or good Manners. For though the Argument be drawne from a Mayden-head lost, yet to be well lost, cleares it from all aspersion. Neither can this be drawne within the Criticall censure of that most horrible Histriomastix, whose vncharitable doome hauing damned all such to the flames of Hell, hath it selfe already suffered a most remarkeable fire here vpon Earth. This hath beene frequently, and publickly Acted without exception, and I presume may be freely read without distaste; and of all in generall: excepting such, whose prepared palats, disgusting all Poems of this nature, are poysoned with the bitter iuice of that Coloquintida and Hemlocke, which can neither relish the peace of the <pb xml:id="ep000073-003-a"/>Church nor Common-weale. Nothing remaineth further to be said, but read charitably, and then censure without preiudice. </p>
        <p>By him who hath beene euer studious of thy fauour, </p>
