        <head>The Argument. </head>
        <p>WHen Alexander the great, after all his Conquests (shining through the glory of innumerable victories) was returned backe to Babylon, where the Ambassadours of the whole worlde did attend his comming, as one that was destinied to domineere ouer all: there being admired by the Grecians, adored by the Barbarians, and as it were drunken with the delights of an extraordinary prosperitie, hee suffered himself to be transported with an inundation of pleasure; till sitting at one of his feasts by the meanes of the sonnes of Antipater his cupbearers, in the best, both of his age and fortune, he was suddenly poisoned. </p>
        <p>Incontinent after his death, those that were in great estimation with himselfe during his life, and then with the armie, assembled themselues together, neglecting for a long time his funeralls, whilst busied about the disposing of his Empire: at last (after diuers opinions) it was concluded, that if Roxane, the widdow of their deceased soueraigne (who was then at the point to bee deliuered of her birth) happened to beare a sonne, hee should succeed in his fathers place, and till he were come to some maturitie of age, Perdiccas, Leonatus, Craterus, and Antipater were appointed to bee his Tutors: But the foote-men in a disdaine, that their aduice was not required, proclaimed Arideus, Alexanders bastard brother <pb xml:id="eng000260-091-a"/>king, and gaue him a guard, of which Meleager procured himselfe to be made Captaine. At this sodaine alteration, the horsemen being troubled, they following Perdiccas pitched their campe without the citie; yet in the end, this tumult being by the eloquence of Perdiccas appeased, all the captaines re-assembled themselues, and hauing diuided the prouinces, made an agreement, which lasted not long: For such was the vehement ambition of those great men, that with all manner of hostilitie, they studied how to vndermine one another, and first of all, Meleager after a pretended reconciliation, (though hauing fled to a Temple for refuge) was slaine by the appointment of Perdiccas, who after aspiring to a superioritie ouer the rest, whilst he went to warre against Ptolomie in Aegypt, by a sudden mutinie of his owne souldiers was miserably murdered. Then the onely captaine of his faction that remained aliue, was Eumenes, a man singularly valorous, who encountering with Craterus and Neoptolemus, by the death of themselues defeated their armie, whereby being highly aduanced, he was greatly enuied, and (Leonatus hauing lately before dyed in a conflict betwixt him and the Athenians,) Antigonus in the name of the rest was sent against him with a great armie, betwixt whom there hauing passed diuers skirmishes with a variable successe, and some priuate conference without agreement: In the end, he was betrayed by his owne souldiers, and deliuered bound to Antigonus, who shortly after caused him to be put to death. </p>
        <p>Then Antigonus (his riuals in the authoritie being remoued out of his way) did aspire to that himselfe, from which he was sent to seclude others, and hauing murdered diuers of the gouernors, hee disposed of their Prouinces as hee pleased: whereof Cassander, Ptolomie, and Lisimachus, aduertised by Seleucus, who fled for feare of incurring the like danger; they entred all together in a league against Antigonus. </p>
        <p>Now at this time Olimpias plagued all the faction of Cassander <pb xml:id="eng000260-091-b"/>in Macedonie, hauing caused Arideus and his Queene Euridice to be put to death; by which, and other cruelties (hauing lost the fauour of the people) shee was constrained, when Cassander came against her, to retire herselfe within a Towne; which (by reason of the scarcitie of victuals) not being able to defend, shee rendred, together with her selfe to Cassander, by whom (notwithstanding of his promise to the contrary) she was publikely put to death, and so hauing proceeded so farre in wickednes, he thought it no time to retire till he had extinguished all his masters race; hee caused Roxane and her sonne to bee murdered; and soone after, Hercules, Alexanders bastard sonne, which multitude of murders, gaue to him the crowne of Macedone; and to me, the Subiect of this Politragicke Tragedie. </p>
